# Laughing with Leaves

## Project Description
This is a riddle game where the user solves various leaf-like riddles in order to grow a tree. The more riddles the user successfully answers, the more the tree grows. If you reach max tree size, you have successfully grown the tree and you win the game!

On the contrary, for every riddle answered incorrectly, the tree's growth process is reversed, and it shrivels. If you reach the minimum tree size, the tree is shrivelled and you lose the game.

## Ties to the theme
This idea incorporates both the tangible and intangible interpretations of the theme "turning a new leaf."
This game literally incorporates various different aspects of leaves by creating witty leaf riddles. They are humourous and can be a great stress-buster game. Helping you improve your overall well-being and turn a new leaf in life.
